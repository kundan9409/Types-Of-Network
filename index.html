<center><img src="network_95.webp" style="width: 50%;"></center>
<p class="define">A network is a computer system that allows devices to interact with each other. Typically, a network can connect to the internet,<br> share files and print documents, depending on which type you're using. Based on the scale and ability of the network,<br> it may be private or available in a specific geographical area.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="understand">How do computer networks work?</h2>
<p class="u">The basic concept of a computer network: a collection of computers (and related equipment) hooked up with wired or wireless links so any machine can exchange information with any other.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-center">Local Area Network</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">Local Area Network is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as building, office.
        LAN is used for connecting two or more personal computers through a communication medium such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, etc.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">It is less costly as it is built with inexpensive hardware such as hubs, network adapters, and ethernet cables.
        The data is transferred at an extremely faster rate in Local Area Network.
        Local Area Network provides higher security.</p>

        <h3 class="w3-center">Personal Area Network</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">Personal Area Network is a network arranged within an individual person, typically within a range of 10 meters.
            Personal Area Network is used for connecting the computer devices of personal use is known as Personal Area Network.
            Thomas Zimmerman was the first research scientist to bring the idea of the Personal Area Network.</p> 
              <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">  Personal Area Network covers an area of 30 feet.
                Personal computer devices that are used to develop the personal area network are the laptop, mobile phones, media player and play stations.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">(MAN)</h1><br>
      <h3 class="w3-center">Metropolitan Area Network</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">A metropolitan area network is a network that covers a larger geographic area by interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network.
        Government agencies use MAN to connect to the citizens and private industries.
        In MAN, various LANs are connected to each other through a telephone exchange line.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"> The most widely used protocols in MAN are RS-232, Frame Relay, ATM, ISDN, OC-3, ADSL, etc.
        It has a higher range than Local Area Network(LAN).</p>

        <h3 class="w3-center">Wide Area Network</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">A Wide Area Network is a network that extends over a large geographical area such as states or countries.
            A Wide Area Network is quite bigger network than the LAN.
            A Wide Area Network is not limited to a single location, but it spans over a large geographical area through a telephone line, fibre optic cable or satellite links.</p> 
              <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">  The internet is one of the biggest WAN in the world.
                A Wide Area Network is widely used in the field of Business, government, and education.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">(CAN)</h1><br>
        <h3 class="w3-center">Campus Area Network</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">CAN is bigger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN. This is a type of computer network that is usually used in places like a school or colleges.
          <br></p> 
              <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">This network covers a limited geographical area that is, it spreads across several buildings within the campus. CAN mainly use Ethernet technology with a range from 1km to 5km.

                Its transmission speed is very high with a moderate maintenance cost and moderate cost.
                
                Examples of CAN are networks that cover schools, colleges, buildings, etc  .</p>

    <h2>Computer Network advantage and disadvantage:</h2>
<h3>Advantage:</h3>
<li>Covers large geographical areas and can connect remote locations.</li>
<li>Provides connectivity to the internet.</li>
<li>Offers remote access to resources and applications.</li>
<li>Can be used to support multiple users and applications simultaneously.</li>
<br>
<h3>Disadvantage:</h3>
<li>Can be expensive to set up and maintain.</li>
<li>Offers slower data transfer rates than LAN or MAN.</li>
<li>May experience higher latency and longer propagation delays due to longer distances and multiple network hops.
</li>
<li>May have lower fault tolerance and security compared to LANs.</li>
